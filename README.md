# react-redux-register-form
Nested forms using create-react-app, redux-form.
Currently it validates, First Name, Last Name, Email, Bank Account IBAN, Bank Name using 'iban' library, regex.

Clone the repo, cd into the repo, run 'yarn install && yarn start' or 'npm install && npm start'.

Things to do next:
custom styling,
